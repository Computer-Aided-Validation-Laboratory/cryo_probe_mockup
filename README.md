# Cryogenic Magnetic Probe Experimental Work

This repository contains work I have done in addition to taking experimental images of the mockup.
This includes:
- Error maps from DIC processing of images taken
- Python scripts to create these error maps from DIC data
- Python scripts to simulate the mock-up in Blender
- Blender generated images
